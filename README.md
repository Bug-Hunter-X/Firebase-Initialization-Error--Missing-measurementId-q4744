# Firebase Initialization Error: Missing 'measurementId'
This repository demonstrates a common Firebase initialization error and its solution. The error occurs when the analytics package is imported, but the `measurementId` is missing from the `firebaseConfig` object.

## Problem
The provided `firebaseConfig.js` file attempts to initialize Firebase. However, because the `measurementId` is missing (even though the analytics package is technically imported - it's commented out here, but might be included by mistake by another developer), the application will throw an error.

## Solution
The `firebaseConfigSolution.js` file provides a corrected configuration. Either include the `measurementId` or remove the `getAnalytics` import.
